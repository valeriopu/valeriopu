Hi there! 👋
</p>

I'm Valerio Pugliese 🍋, a `Biomedical Engineering` student at Politecnico di Torino. I am currently working on my master thesis about prognostic patient monitoring through Artificial Intelligence at `The Netherlands Cancer Institute` (Amsterdam, NL).
In my repositories you will find the most interesting projects carried out during my studies: these involve various areas, such as biomedical image processing, rehabilitation engineering or neuroengineering. 

In a nutshell, I'm just a sicilian kiddo who is looking for his place in the world.
