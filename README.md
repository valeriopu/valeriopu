Hi there! üëã
</p>

I'm Valerio Pugliese üçã, a `Biomedical Engineer` graduated at Politecnico di Torino. I am currently a PhD student in Artificial Intelligence at `The Netherlands Cancer Institute` (Amsterdam, NL), in the departments of Radiology and Thoracic Oncology. My doctoral program will focus on the development and application of AI strategies to improve the diagnosis and the follow-up of oncological patients affected by malignant pleural mesothelioma. In my repositories you will find the most interesting projects I worked on: these involve various areas, such as biomedical image processing, rehabilitation engineering or neuroengineering.
